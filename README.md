Sport Dots Game (analogue of Go)

Multiplayer client for games, group analysis
The project implements a system of endless rooms with an unlimited number of participants
Sgf reader/writer, many analysis tools, unique scoring system algorithm, chat, comments etc.

At the beginning the project was built on the ECS architecture, but in the end it was built differently.
For multiplayer I used Photon Unity Networking.
